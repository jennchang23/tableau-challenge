## DASHBOARD 1 - INSIGHTS

    • Rental activity is impacted by differences in weekday vs. weekend activities
        - On weekdays, commuting to & from work is a big reason bikers rent with peak commuting hours comprising ~40% of the daily rentals (7-9am, 6-8pm)
        - On the other hand, weekend rentals are likely to happen more evenly throughout the day as people are spending more time going to/from various leisurely activites
    • citiBike is a method of travel for people regardless of their travel being for work/play
        - The blue bar chart shows that day of week does not significantly impact the volume of bikes being rented with weekdays having only a slightly higher share of rentals 
    • While there is no seasonal impact on these hourly/day of weekend trends, there are less people renting bikes in Q4 during chillier months

## DASHBOARD 2 - INSIGHTS

    • citiBike is not just for short commutes
        - The dataset does not include rentals that started outside of Jersey City or the distance traveled, however, the multiple red dots showing bike returns all over Manhattan show that citiBike is not just for short commutes
        - Filtering the map to showcase weekday data, suggests most of the longer travel rides into the city are by commuters
        - On Weekend, most riders are staying within Jersey city as they travel to/from activities close to home

## DASHBOARD 3 - INSIGHTS

    • Due to COVID-19, 2020 rentals are significantly down YoY
        - Compared to Jan-May of 2019, rentals are down this year by roughly 56%
        - The location of bike returns show that no one is traveling into the city for work anymore as most companies transitioned to a work from home policy
        - Those who are renting have stayed within their neighborhoods as there were shelter at home mandates enforced by local officials
